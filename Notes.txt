1) Installed Xcode 8 beta 6
2) Created new project (single view application)
3) Created Podfile with SwiftyDropbox dependency
4) Ran pod install
5) Open generated workspace in xcode-beta
6) Asked to convert to swift 2.3 or 3.0 -
   swiftlydropbox is not 3.0 ready it also depends on alamofire
   alamofire has a beta that supports 3.0
   => decided to fork/submodule swiftlydropbox to have it use the beta alamofire and to support 3.0
